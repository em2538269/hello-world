function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

% You need to set these values correctly
X_norm = X;
mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: First, for each feature dimension, compute the mean
%               of the feature and subtract it from the dataset,
%               storing the mean value in mu. Next, compute the 
%               standard deviation of each feature and divide
%               each feature by it's standard deviation, storing
%               the standard deviation in sigma. 
%
%               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a 
%               feature and each row is an example. You need 
%               to perform the normalization separately for 
%               each feature. 
%
% Hint: You might find the 'mean' and 'std' functions useful.
%       

% X is a m x 2 matrix, making mu and sigma 2 x 1
% For each column of X I want to take the mean and subtract it, then the standard deviation and divide by it
% I did this by applying the 2 x 1 row vector to every row of X using a for loop
% this will work for an arbitrary matrix m x n but I'd like to vectorize it without a for loop

mu = mean(X);
sigma = std(X);

for i = 1:size(X,1);
    X(i,:) = (X(i,:) - mu)./sigma;
end
X_norm = X;
